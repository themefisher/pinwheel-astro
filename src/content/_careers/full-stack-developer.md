You might not have experience with all the technologies in our stack, but you are motivated to learn deeply. You will get the opportunity to work with both Go and Elixir with experienced team mates who can teach and pair with you to learn whatever you have less experience with.You care about security, code quality, scalability, performance, and simplicity. Above all, you seek operational excellence and apply the best engineering practices possible.
